Type of game: platformer

A corrupt robot factory creates robots everyday that must follow strict orders. If a robot is
created badly, it is thrown into the incinerator and scrapped. One robot, who knew the impending doom
of the others, escaped to find power to destroy the factory.

Ideas:

shooting maybe
boss fight maybe
have powerups along the way
cutscene at the start explains story (skippable)
dodges other robots along the way (bullet hell enemies)
normal movement set + maybe wall climbs and dashes
difficult platforming sections, try to build a physics script that doesn't allow wall jumping
encourage dashing

robot goes around places to gain power orbs to slowly gain power to take down the factory?
or maybe he fights the owner of the factory at the end (will need boss fight which is hard)
